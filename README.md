# Loading Tech [Indev]

Loading Tech is a News Website made for our final project of the year, it mainly contains stuff we learned through the year about Computer Science.

This Branch is for the code that's almost ready for deploy.
This version of the website will contain bugs, but it will be fixed before being pushed to.

For the latest version please check the [Main Branch](https://github.com/SimplyOrtiz/LoadingTech/tree/main) 
or for the latest untested code check the [Code-Dump Branch](https://github.com/SimplyOrtiz/LoadingTech/tree/code-dump)
