# Loading Tech [Code-Dump]

Loading Tech is a News Website made for our final project of the year, it mainly contains stuff we learned through the year about Computer Science.

This Branch as the name says it's just a bunch of code dumped for testing and tweaking.
This version of the website has the latest code of the project, but it may not be functional or final.

For the latest version please check the [Main Branch](https://github.com/SimplyOrtiz/LoadingTech/tree/main) 
or for the lastest code check the [Indev Branch](https://github.com/SimplyOrtiz/LoadingTech/tree/indev)
